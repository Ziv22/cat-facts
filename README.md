# Ziv's CatFacts

Welcome To CatFacts.
The app that brings you fascinating facts about cats!
In order to develop this project I used: Angular(11.2.12), Node.js & MongoDB with mongoose library.

## Setup

### Pre-request

 1. Make sure to have node installed  https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
 2. Make sure to have MongoDB installed  https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.
 3. Then make sure to run "mongod" in background while working with the app.
 4. Make sure to have Angular installed  https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli.

### Setup the project

1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/Ziv22/cat-facts.
2. Run npm install in the project's root directory.
3. Make sure you've ran "mongod" on the background.
4. Navigate to the ./Server directory and run "node server.js".
5. Navigate back to the project's root directory and run "ng serve --open", this will start the project and run it on your default browser in http://localhost:4200/all-facts

Now you're ready to use the app :]
